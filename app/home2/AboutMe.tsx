                            Hey I'm John Dufresne! Growing up in Poughkeepsie, New York, I was always fascinated by building and learning, from disassembling and reassembling things around the house, to fixing cars in my dad's garage.
                            This hands-on curiosity eventually led me to a programming class in high school, where I discovered a new way to build and problem-solve.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I went on to study Computer Science at UCF, diving mainly into full-stack development while also exploring cybersecurity and AI. While at UCF, I led a team developing a cross-platform application for U.S.
                            Army Reservistsâ€”managing both frontend and backend systems and implementing CI/CD pipelines to streamline our workflow. This experience reinforced my approach to software: balancing development, automation, and teamwork to build scalable solutions.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At my core, I love solving problems, learning new things, and building systems that just work. Whether it's fixing a car, debugging a tricky issue, or architecting a complex application, I'm always up for the challenge.
                            Currently, I'm seeking a full-stack developer position where I can leverage my technical skills and collaborative approach to create impactful solutions.
